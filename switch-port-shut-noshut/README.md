#### The purpose of the [`up_down_interfaces_by_the_state.py`](https://github.com/jamalshahverdiev/python-general-public-codes/blob/master/switch-port-shut-noshut/up_down_interfaces_by_the_state.py) script to analyze the status of the `INPUT_PORT` from `config.ini` file and execute command for the `OUTPUT_PORT`. If inside of the printed lines for `INPUT_PORT` will be string `disabled` then, `no shutdown` command will be executed for `OUTPUT_PORT`. If inside of the printed lines for `INPUT_PORT` will be string `notconnect` then, `shutdown` command will be executed for `OUTPUT_PORT`

#### Just edit `config.ini` file for the credentials and ports

#### I don't remember real purpose of this code files but, I wrote this long time ago for the network engineers
